# Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Disaster Tweets

Overview:
---------
This repository contains the code and documentation for my participation in the Kaggle challenge: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. The goal of the challenge was to develop a model to accurately classify whether a given tweet is related to a real disaster or not.

Key Features:
--------------
- Tweet Processing with Spacy: Utilized Spacy for accurate and efficient tweet processing, enhancing the model's understanding of natural language.
- Logistic Regression Model: Developed a logistic regression model for disaster tweet classification, leveraging its simplicity and interpretability.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted rigorous hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. Achieved a commendable accuracy of 0.79803 using the F1 score.

Dependencies:
--------------
- Python 3.x
- Spacy
- Scikit-learn
